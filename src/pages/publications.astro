    title="Cyclic loading of human articular cartilage: the transition from compaction to fatigue"
    img="/cartilagepaper.jpg"
    desc="Osteoarthritis damages cartilage, reducing mobility and quality of life. While current treatments manage pain, none truly reverse the condition. Studying the mechanics of healthy cartilage under loads like walking could reveal how fatigue damages it, leading to earlier diagnoses and better interventions before significant degeneration occurs. This study aims to understand this transition from normal function to fatigue damage in healthy human cartilage using various loading conditions."

    title="Chondrocyte viability is lost during high-rate impact loading by transfer of amplified strain, but not stress, to pericellular and cellular regions"
    img="/indenterpaper.jpg"
    desc="Traumatic injury damages cartilage, starting a chain reaction leading to osteoarthritis. This study examines how fast vs. slow impacts affect cartilage cells and mechanics, hoping to identify factors minimizing damage and cell death. We used bovine cartilage samples and tracked cell viability and changes in tissue properties after impacts at different speeds. Multi-scale modeling helped visualize stress and strain patterns within the cartilage during impacts."
